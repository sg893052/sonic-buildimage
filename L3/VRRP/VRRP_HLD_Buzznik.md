# About this Manual

This document provides general overview of VRRP feature implementation based on RFC 5798 & SAG feature implementation in SONiC. 



# 1 Introduction and Scope

Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) functionality is designed to eliminate the single point of
failure inherent in the static default routed environment. VRRP specifies an election protocol that
dynamically assigns responsibility of gateway router to one of the VRRP routers on a LAN. The VRRP
router controlling the IP(v6) address(es) associated with a virtual router is called the Master, and routes the
traffic. The election process provides dynamic fail-over in the forwarding responsibility should the Master
become unavailable. Any of the virtual router&#39;s IP(v6) addresses on a LAN can then be used as the default first
hop router by end-hosts. The advantage gained from using VRRP is a higher availability default path
without requiring configuration of dynamic routing or router discovery protocols on every end-host.

Static Anycast Gateway (SAG) allows multiple switches to simultaneously route packets from a common IP address in an active-active router configuration.
Each switch is configured with the same set of virtual IP addresses on corresponding VLAN interfaces and a common virtual MAC address.

Static Anycast Gateway feature provides ability to configure same set of gateway IPs on Vlan interfaces across routers without need to run any election protocol.
Unlike VRRP, SAG does not run any state machine for master router election. All access routers configured with same set of SAG IP provides gateway functionality.
This allows multiple routers to simultaneously route packets destined to these gateway IPs.
Each switch is configured with same set of Gateway IPs and common Gateway MAC.

In MCLAG deployments, SAG is preferred over MCLAG-VARP since SAG provides gateway functionality with Active-Active router configuration across MCLAG.

In IP Fabric deployments, SAG is preferred over VRRP and MCLAG-VARP since SAG provides gateway across MCLAG nodes which is necessary
for seamless VM move across servers connected to different leaf nodes.

# 2 Feature Requirements

SAG does not store any state information. After warm-reboot, SAG IPs will be programmed once corresponding Vlan interface comes up.



# 3 Feature Description

## 3.1 Target Deployment use cases

The following are some of the deployment use cases for VRRP and SAG

- The Leaf nodes of the Clos network to provide first hop redundency to connected devices
- SAG to provide Active-Active gateway redundancy in MCLAG deployment across MCLAG.
- SAG to provide Active-Active gateway redundancy in IP-Fabric deployment to provide same gateway across multiple leaf nodes.
 
## 3.1.1 VRRP & SAG Use cases:

### **VRRP on MCLAG:**
- VRRP when configured on MCLAG, Data traffic from Server can take sub-optimal path over MCLAG peer link.
- In these deployments, MCLAG-VARP OR SAG is preferred over VRRP.

![VRRP_MCLAG_USECASE1](image/VRRP_MCLAG_Usecase1.png "Figure 3.1.1 : VRRP on MCLAG")

### **SAG configured on MCLAG and remote leaf nodes, BGP-EVPN is used for ARP/ND Synchronization:**

- With this VM move from Server-1 to Server-2 will ensure non-disruptive data path from VM1, since same gateway exists on remote leaf node.
- BGP EVPN is used in these types of topologies, VMs on Server-1 and Server-2 will be configured with same SAG gateway
- Irrespective of leaf node on which ARP/nd request is originated to VM, ARP response will be consumed by receiving leaf node, learning corresponding VM.
  These MACIP route(Type-2) will be synchronized to all other leaf nodes using BGP EVPN.
  
![SAG_IPFABRIC_UC2](image/SAG_IPFabric_Usecase2.png "Figure 3.1.2 : SAG on IP Fabric")

### **SAG configured on MCLAG and remote leaf nodes interconnected with L2 Cloud:**

#### Issue:
- There is no ARP/ND Sync between MCLAG Pair and Leaf-3.
- If SAG alone is configured, ARP request from Leaf3 would use SAG IP as source.
- ARP response will get consumed by Leaf1 or Leaf2 and VM1 will remain unresolved on Leaf3 resulting in traffic loss

![SAG_NOREALIP_UC3](image/SAG_NOREALIP_UC3.png "Figure 3.1.3.1 : SAG Alone on Vlan interface")

#### Solution:
- SAG & Real interface IP is configured on MCLAG & remote Leaf nodes
- Since there is no ARP/ND synchronization across remote leaf nodes and across MCLAG, ARP/nd resolution should be triggered using unique real interface IP.
- ARP/ND request to VMs will be generated using real interface IP rather than SAG IP so that response will be received by the originator leaf node.

## 3.2 Functional Description of VRRP

VRRP specifies an election protocol to provide the virtual router function described earlier. All protocol
messaging is performed using IP multicast datagrams, thus the protocol can operate over a variety of
multiaccess LAN technologies supporting IP multicast. Each VRRP virtual router has a single well-known
MAC address allocated to it. This document currently only details the mapping to networks using the IEEE
802 48-bit MAC address. The virtual router MAC address is used as the source in all periodic VRRP
messages sent by the Master router to enable bridge learning in an extended LAN.
A virtual router is defined by its virtual router identifier (VRID) and a set of IP addresses. A VRRP router
may associate a virtual router with its real addresses on an interface, and may also be configured with
additional virtual router mappings and priority for virtual routers it is willing to backup. The mapping
between VRID and addresses must be coordinated among all VRRP routers on a LAN. However, there is
no restriction against reusing a VRID with a different address mapping on different LANs. The scope of
each virtual router is restricted to a single LAN.
To minimize network traffic, only the Master for each virtual router sends periodic VRRP Advertisement
messages. A Backup router will not attempt to preempt the Master unless it has higher priority. This
eliminates service disruption unless a more preferred path becomes available. It&#39;s also possible to
administratively prohibit all preemption attempts. The only exception is that a VRRP router will always
become Master of any virtual router associated with addresses it owns. If the Master becomes unavailable
then the highest priority Backup will transition to Master after a short delay, providing a controlled
transition of the virtual router responsibility with minimal service interruption.
The VRRP protocol design provides rapid transition from Backup to Master to minimize service
interruption, and incorporates optimizations that reduce protocol complexity while guaranteeing
controlled Master transition for typical operational scenarios. The optimizations result in an election
protocol with minimal runtime state requirements, minimal active protocol states, and a single message
type and sender. The typical operational scenarios are defined to be two redundant routers and/or distinct
path preferences among each router. A side effect when these assumptions are violated (i.e., more than two redundant paths all with equal preference) is that duplicate packets may be forwarded for a brief period during Master election. However, the typical scenario assumptions are likely to cover the vast majority of deployments, loss of the Master router is infrequent, and the expected duration in Master election convergence is quite small ( &lt;&lt; 1 second ). Thus the VRRP optimizations represent significant
simplifications in the protocol design while incurring an insignificant probability of brief network
degradation.
Though VRRP standard protocol present in RFC 3768 and RFC 5798 are complete in itself, there are few
limitations/drawbacks of the protocol:

1. The point of failure which VRRP safeguards against is the interface on which VRRP instance is
present and the router as a whole. Even if all of the connectivity of master to the external network
fails, VRRP will still not trigger the failover to the backup gateway. Uplink interface tracking feature has been introduced to overcome this limitation
2. Only master router sends the advertisements, and backups just listen to them. Since backups do
not send any periodic message, it is difficult to ascertain that the backups are still active, and the
healthiness of the backup routers can not be known until the failover happens.
3. VRRP owner - if a VRRP instance's virtual IP address is same as the real interface IP address. VRRP owner has special privileges (priority is 255) and can preempt any other router acting as master. This usually causes unwanted temporary network disruption after the non-owner master had stabilized
after the failover from owner.
4. A non-owner master can not accept packets destined to the virtual IP address. Only the owner can
accept and respond to such packets.
5. Two virtual routers with same VRIDs but on different IP subnets can not co-exist on the same
VLAN because of the virtual MAC address clash.

### 3.2.1 Virtual Router Owner

VRRP instance whose virtual IP address (VIP) is same as real interface address is called the owner of virtual router and has the highest priority. VRRP owner is supported in SONIC's VRRP implementation.

### 3.2.2 Virtual MAC Address

Following virtual MAC addresses is used by the protocol (as per RFC 5798)

IPv4 case: **00-00-5e-00-01-{vrid}**

IPv6 case: **00-00-5e-00-02-{vrid}**

where, vrid is user configured 1-byte virtual router identifier. VRID has interface scope; that is, VRID has to be unique among the VRRP instances on an interface. However, same VRID can be used for two  or more virtual router instances across different interfaces.


### 3.2.3    Preemption

Preemption is turned on by default.  Even if preemption is disabled, it does not affect the owner router since owner preempts the active master. Mastership switchover causes unnecessary temporary network disruption.

### 3.2.4    VRRP Advertisement Frame

VRRP control packets have IP protocol type as 112 (reserved for VRRP). IPv4 and IPv6 VRRP keepalives are sent to VRRP multicast address 224.0.0.18 and FF02::12 respectively. Source MAC in VRRP control packets is virtual MAC address                                                               

### 3.2.5    ARP Request Handling 

Only master responds to the ARP requests for virtual IP address. In ARP replies sent by master, the source MAC in Ethernet header and ARP payload is virtual MAC address.

In case of SAG, all ARP requests destined to SAG Gateway IP address will be responded by any receiving leaf node on which SAG Gateway IP is configured.

In case of ARP request origination from interface where SAG and Interface IP both are configured:
    - If both Interface IP and SAG IP are in same subnet
        - ARP request will be generated with Interface IP as source IP.
    - If Interface IP and SAG IP are in different subnet
        - If destination is in SAG IP subnet, SAG IP will be used as source IP in ARP request
        - For all other IP interface IP will be used as source IP in ARP request.

### 3.2.6   Uplink Interface Tracking

Interfaces other than the VRRP instance interface can be tracked for up/down events. When interface-tracking is enabled in the VRRP instance configuration, the tracked interface's operational status will be monitored. When a interface operational down event is detected on a tracked-interface, the track-priority/weight is subtracted from the current router‚Äôs priority value. Similarly, when interface operational up event is detected on the tracked-interface, the track-priority/weight is added to the router‚Äôs current priority value.

The dynamic change of router priority can trigger mastership switchover if the preemption is enabled. **However, if the router is an owner, the mastership switchover will not happen**.

Maximum number of interfaces that can be tracked for a virtual router instance is 8.

## 3.3 Functional Description of SAG

In most of Leaf-Spine deployments, redundancy in Spine layer is required to achieve high availability and to prevent network service disruption. Modern layer 2 networks adopted loop-free and balanced path networks using Multi Chassis Link Aggregation topologies with LACP port channels, leaving loop control methods (STP) as second protection layer. Spines also supports layer 3 networks, using ECMP in a scalable network topology. For unicast redundancy in layer 3, a common method is to use Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) to provide a simple and unique gateway at Leaf level. Although VRRP provides redundancy, it is active-standby protocol and does not provide a balanced data traffic distribution over Multi Chassis Link Aggregated topologies. Also in IP-Fabric topologies VRRP cannot be used since it does not provide seamless VM move across servers with optimal routing between VMs.

SAG provides better data traffic balancing and faster redundancy convergence, implementing active-active First Hop Router Redundancy to provide active/active unicast IP routing. 

The primary benefit of using SAG is that all configured routers are active and are able to perform routing. SAG also provides rapid failover in the event of a link or switch failure, while enabling the sharing of IP forwarding load between both switches. SAG requires configuring the same gateway IP address on the appropriate VLAN interfaces of both peers, as well as a global unique gateway MAC address. SAG functions by having both switches respond to ARP requests and Gratuitous ARP for a configured IP address with the ‚Ägateway‚Äù MAC address. If IP routing is enabled, received packets will be routed as follows: when the DMAC of a packet destined to a remote network matches the configured ‚Äúgateway‚Äù MAC address, each router locally forwards the traffic to its next hop destination.

### 3.3.1 Virtual MAC Address

For SAG, user has to explicitly configure SAG Gateway MAC on the switch for SAG to be active. The switch maps all SAG IP addresses to this MAC address.
If user configures SAG Gateway MAC, it will be applicable for both IPv4 and IPv6. User can explicitly enable or disable per address-family gateway status.

Upon changing SAG Gateway MAC, SAG gateway IP on all interfaces will be brought down and brought UP again with new gateway MAC.

# 4 Feature Design



## 4.1 Design Overview

### 4.1.1 Basic Approach

Keepalived (https://www.keepalived.org/) open source code is chosen for VRRP control plane code.

![VRRP Keepalived Design](image/VRRP_Keepalived_design.png "Figure : Design")


### 4.1.2 Container

A new container "vrrp" has been added to host VRRP protocol operation. VRRP source code is not maintained in SONIC repos. Instead, VRRP code is downloaded from keeplaived project repo at the compile time, patches are applied to it (for any fixes by us) and then compiled/linked with SONIC binary.

New container "vrrp" handles only VRRP functionality.
For SAG the configuration is programmed in kernel through 'vrrpmgrd' module and 'vrrpsyncd' programs the hardware entry in SAI.

### 4.1.3 SAI Overview

VRRP virtual router interface can be created by setting the attribute  ‚ÄúSAI_ROUTER_INTERFACE_ATTR_IS_VIRTUAL‚Äù with **create_router_interface** API.

     * @brief RIF creation is a virtual RIF.
     *
     * Create a Virtual RIF object, which only programs the ingress router MAC.
     * This simplifies the management of VRRP master router's configuration in
     * SAI adapter, as defined by RFC 5798 (or similar proprietary protocols).
     * Using a Virtual RIF allows SAI to optimize resources, so neighbor entries
     * cannot be learned on a Virtual RIF. On a virtual RIF following attributes
     * are invalid: ADMIN state, MTU size, packet action and multicast enable.
     * Alternatively VRRP can also be configured using native RIF objects without
     * using VIRTUAL attribute, with the expectation that SAI adapter will consume
     * resources that will not be used.
     *
     * @type bool
     * @flags CREATE_ONLY
     * @default false

## 6 Serviceability and Debug

The existing logging mechanisms shall be used. Proposed debug framework shall be used for internal state dump.

**Sonic Show commands**
```
show ip interface
    - Displays active VRRP VIP on interface
```

**Sonic logging commands**
```
show logging vrrpsyncd
    - Displays logs generated by vrrpsyncd for programming VIP and VMAC for VRRP and SAG IP & Gateway MAC for SAG
show logging keepalive
    - Displays logs from keepalived docker where vrrpd process is run.
show logging orchagent
    - Displays logs from orchagent including vrrporchagt.
```

**Linux Debug commands**
```
ip addr show type macvlan
    - Lists MACVLAN interface in linux kernel corresponding to VRRP and SAG interfaces
    - Displays VMAC corresponding to each MACVLAN interface
    - Displays VIP configured on MACVLAN interface
    - Displays parent interface name under which VRRP/SAG is configured
    - Status of MACVLAN interface in kernel

ip -d link show type macvlan
    - Lists MACVLAN interface including various attributes for these netdevice

ip -s link show type macvlan
    - Lists MACVLAN interface and count of different types of RX/TX packets on these interfaces.

```


## 7 Warm Reboot Support

Currently, warm-reboot is not supported for VRRP. That is, warm-reboot will simply restart the VRRP docker without VRRP storing any data for warm restart. 

SAG is implemented in vrrpmgrd process which is placed in swss docker.
In case of swss docker warm reboot, since SAG information is maintained in kernel, when vrrpmgrd starts up it will recover SAG information from kernel.
